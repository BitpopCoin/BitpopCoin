This was a fair launch. I only own 1,000 BPC! For this reason, there are no bounties currently available.

BitpopCoin is our coin, not mine. BPC is designed to have a long life, development will be slow and steady.

This is a community coin, I invite you to volunteer for tasks or pledge your own bounties. Join the team and I'll add you to the op.

Still looking for a few good block explorers, exchanges, developers, marketers, designers and investors!
